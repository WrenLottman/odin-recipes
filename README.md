This is the first official "project" that I will be completing as part of the Odin Project. I will be creating a basic recipe website. My expectation is that it looks fairly basic (I believe they used the word Brutalist in the project instruction description). But I think it's going to be good practice.

I'm so glad to have reached the first official capital P project in this whole process. It was a lot of fun! Looking forward to getting through the CSS foundations to add some more stuff to it. It was a bit hard at first to remember to keep doing commits even when I wasn't done. So I didn't necessarily succeed wildly with keeping my commits atomic.

On to the next one!
