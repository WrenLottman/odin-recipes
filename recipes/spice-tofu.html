    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>According to Maangchi herself, this dish is part of Korean Buddhist temple cuisine. She describes it as sweet, spicy, crunchy, and easy to make.
        I can confirm that all of that is true. In my opinion it is the best "breaded and covered in flavorful sauce" thing that I've ever had. While
        that is most likely because it is extremely fresh, it is still the case. I highly recommend!</p>
            <br>
        <p>Before getting into the details, I will warn fellow spice-nervous people that it might be a bit spicy. My spouse and I have found our spice comfort
        zone to be about one half to two-thirds of the gochujang called for. But I recommend making it with the full amount first so you can see how it is
        for you. Because even when it was too hot for us, it was delicious and we ate it all anyway.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul></ul>
        <li>2 cups begetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>14 ounces to 1 pound firm tofu cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice syrup (or other sweetener. we once used maple syrup and it was great)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol></ol>
        <li>Combine ketchup, rice syrup, and gochujang in a skillet. Heat over medium high, stirring
            for about 1 to 2 minutes until bubbling. Remove from heat and set the skillet aside.</li>
        <li>Gently put the cut tofu into a plastic bag or container and add the potato starch. Gently turn it over
            until the tofu is well and evenly coated with the starch.</li>
        <li>Remove each piece individually and transfer to a plate or cutting board lined with plastic wrap, leaving
            leaving some room between pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet for about 5 minutes or until it reaches around 330 degrees fahrenheit. Carefully add the tofu pieces one at a time to the hot oil. Turn the heat down to medium and let the tofu cook for about about 2 to 3 minutes, until the bottom turns light brown and the surface is a little crispy.</li>
        <li>Turn the tofu pieces with tongs or a slotted spoon—they should be firm enough to turn without breaking—and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes, occasionally turning so that all sides turn light brown and crispy. Remove from the skillet and set in a wire mesh strainer set over a bowl.</li>
        <li>Reheat the oil for 1 minute over medium-high heat and fry all the tofu again for 3 to 4  minutes, rotating and turning them over with tongs or long wooden chopsticks, until all sides are golden brown and crunchy.</li>
        <li>Transfer the tofu to the strainer set over a bowl to drain the excess oil.</li>
        <li>If you use pumpkin seeds, put them into a slotted spoon and dip them into the hot oil to fry them for just 10 seconds or so. Transfer the seeds to a small bowl and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Reheat the sauce in the skillet until bubbling. Add the fried tofu and gently mix all together until they are well coated.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate and sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over top. Serve as a side dish for rice.</li>
