    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>According to Maangchi herself, this dish is part of Korean Buddhist temple cuisine. She describes it as sweet, spicy, crunchy, and easy to make.
        I can confirm that all of that is true. In my opinion it is the best "breaded and covered in flavorful sauce" thing that I've ever had. While
        that is most likely because it is extremely fresh, it is still the case. I highly recommend!</p>
            <br>
        <p>Before getting into the details, I will warn fellow spice-nervous people that it might be a bit spicy. My spouse and I have found our spice comfort
        zone to be about one half to two-thirds of the gochujang called for. But I recommend making it with the full amount first so you can see how it is
        for you. Because even when it was too hot for us, it was delicious and we ate it all anyway.
